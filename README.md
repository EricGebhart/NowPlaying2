NowPlaying2
===========

Nightingale/songbird plugin that adds a nowplaying queue.

This is almost the same now playing-2 extension as the one at getNightingale.com.

The difference is the addition of a -fade to next- button and slider that allows
for an automatic fade out and skip to next song.

To Do
=====

Still needed is the ability to drag and drop items in the list after they have been placed there.

There may be other things but that's the big missing feature that I can currently see.
